The aim is for students working with these resources to develop an adequate MT literacy for their later professional career while at the same time becoming data-savvy citizens well equipped for the modern knowledge economy. The project's results are didactic resources to teach the various sub-competencies outlined in Ridsdale et al.\u2019s Data Literacy Competencies Matrix in their translation-specific form of MT literacy. The teaching resources are publicly available on this website. These resources at the interface of MT literacy and data literacy can complement the teaching resources developed in the context of more extensive MT training initiatives. You can access our GitHub account . On this account you will find specific learning resoures in the form of papers, Colab notebooks and videos made available by the DataLit MT team.
