You can watch the accompanying tutorial video on data planning and collection at the advanced level here . Data Processing: NMT Training In this learning resource you will learn how to train your own NMT model from scratch (optionally, using the data you have prepared in the 'Data Planning and Collection' resource) and evaluate your translation quality. Advanced Level The Colab notebook on data processing at the advanced level can be found in our GitHub folder here . You can watch the accompanying tutorial video on data processing at the advanced level here . Quality Evaluation: Automatic Evaluation Metrics In this learning resource you will learn how to evaluate the quality of machine translations by calculating automatic evaluation metrics (AEMs). We cover two string-matching metrics BLEU and TER, and two embedding-based metrics BERTScore and COMET. You will learn theoretical understanding of these metrics, particularly in the companion notebooks below, and how to calculate these metrics at sentence and at document level. Basic Level The Colab notebook on quality evaluation at the basic level can be found in our GitHub folder here .

Topics cover different aspects of data culture and ethics, terminology, data preparation, NMT training and data evaluation. Based on the difficulty of these learning resources, they are structured for either basic or advanced level, as defined in the Competence Matrix. The learning resources differ in formats ranging from theoretical overviews, to papers, to notebooks, to videos.
